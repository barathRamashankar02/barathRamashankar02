üìö Notable Projects
Cyber Bullying Detection

Built an NLP model (Autoencoder + TensorFlow) to detect hate speech, achieving 98.7% accuracy in test chatrooms.
Reduced online cyberbullying significantly on child-friendly platforms.
Movie Scripts Retrieval-Augmented Chat (RAG)

Implemented a system to store and query movie scripts in a vector database for context-based Q&A.
Provided both simple QA and memory-enabled conversations via LangChain and Gradio.
Comparative Analysis of Transformer Models

Evaluated BERT, T5, and GPT for non-autoregressive tasks like classification, NER, summarization, and sentence similarity.
Highlighted each architecture‚Äôs strengths (e.g., 96.1% precision on NER with BERT).
Customer Segmentation & Analysis

Utilized Power BI dashboards and RFM-based clustering to identify trends, improving e-commerce marketing strategies.
Streamlined large-scale data pipelines for in-depth forecasting and analysis.
Sentiment Analysis on Fake News (2020 US Election)

Fine-tuned Llama 3 to detect fake news (~86% accuracy on 155k tweets).
Leveraged RoBERTa and LDA for sentiment classification and topic modeling, unveiling key political discourse themes.
